<h1>Flutter Task</h1>

## Task-1

The task is to implement a small app that will list the most starred Github repos
that were created in the last 30 days. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the
Github API.

## Features
As a User I should be able to list the most starred GitHub repos that were created in the last 30
days.
As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details:

o Repository name
o Repository description
o Numbers of stars for the repo.
o Username and avatar of the owner.
